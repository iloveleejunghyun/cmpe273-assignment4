# cache and bloom filter based on midterm

## Installation
	
## Example:
![Image text](https://github.com/iloveleejunghyun/cmpe273-assignment4/blob/master/switch.png)  
In cache_client.py, you can see there are 3 lines(14~16) to switch among naive hash, RHW hash and Virtual Node Consistent hash.



# Consistent Hashing and RHW Hashing

The distributed cache you implemented in the midterm is based on naive modula hashing to shard the data.

## Part I.

Implement Rendezvous hashing to shard the data.


## Part II.

Implement consistent hashing to shard the data.

Features:

* Add virtual node layer in the consistent hashing.
* Implement virtual node with data replication.
